# Database_Management_Project

Scholarships and financial aid are important resources for many college students, particularly those from low-income families. Despite the numerous scholarships and financial aid options from federal, government, and other organizations, many students are unaware of their eligibility or even the existence of these aids. To address this, we propose the Smart Scholarship and Financial Aid System, which aims to streamline the scholarship and financial aid discovery and application process for students in the City University of New York (CUNY) system. Using student data, the system will filter and suggest scholarships that align with each student's eligibility. Detailed information about each scholarship including its requirements, along with a direct application link will be provided to the student. 


In this project we propose an efficient database structure for the system created using MariaDB and SQL. We also apply data normalization and other database management principles to design the database model.
