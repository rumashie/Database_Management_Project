# Database Management Project
This project focuses on designing an efficient database structure for a proposed scholarship system. We aimed to create an efficient database that adheres to database management principles. 

## Project Summary

### Key Achievements:
- **Normalization:** Applied normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy. 
- **Entity Relationship Design:** Identified and defined appropriate entities, relationships, attributes, domains, and keys for the database.
- **ER Diagram Development:** Crafted a comprehensive Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to visually represent the database structure and relationships between different components.
- **Database Implementation:** Translated the conceptual ER diagram into a fully functional MySQL database. Defined tables, relationships, and constraints within the MySQL environment.
- **Data Population:** Generated and inserted a substantial dataset, with at least 50 tuples for each table, to simulate real-world scenarios and demonstrate the database's capacity.
