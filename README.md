# Database_Management_Project
In this project, we designed an efficient database structure for a proposed scholarship system using our understanding of data normalization and other database management principles.

Developed associated ER diagram. Mapped the ER diagram, and showed how data was normalized, listed integrity
constraints. Defined the database in MySQL and insert at least 50 tuples into every table.
